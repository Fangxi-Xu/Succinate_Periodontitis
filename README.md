# Targeting Succinate Receptor Effectively Inhibits Periodontitis
Periodontal disease (PD), one of the most common inflammatory diseases in humans, is initiated by an oral microbial dysbiosis that stimulates inflammation and bone loss. Here, we report an abnormal elevation of succinate in severe PD patientsâ€™ gingival tissues. Succinate activates the succinate receptor-1 (SUCNR1) and stimulates inflammation. We detected SUCNR1 expression in both human and mouse gingival tissues and hypothesized that succinate activates SUCNR1 to accelerate periodontitis through the inflammatory response. We proved that SUCNR1 knockout mice are protected from oral dysbiosis, inflammation, and subsequent periodontal bone loss in two different models of periodontitis. Therapeutic studies have demonstrated that a novel antagonist of SUCNR1 inhibits inflammatory events and osteoclastogenesis in vitro and reduces periodontal bone loss in vivo. Mechanistically, the SUCNR1 antagonist decreased microbial dysbiosis and inflammation levels. Our study reveals a previously unknown action of succinate in promoting periodontitis and provides a novel topical treatment for this disease.
