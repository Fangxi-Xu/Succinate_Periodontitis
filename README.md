# Targeting Succinate Receptor Effectively Inhibits Periodontitis
Periodontal disease (PD) is one of the most common inflammatory diseases in humans and is initiated by an oral microbial dysbiosis that stimulates inflammation and bone loss. Here, we report an abnormal elevation of succinate in the subgingival plaque of subjects with severe PD. Succinate activates the succinate receptor-1 (SUCNR1) and stimulates inflammation. We detected SUCNR1 expression in the human and mouse periodontium and hypothesize that succinate activates SUCNR1 to accelerate periodontitis through the inflammatory response. Administration of exogenous succinate enhanced periodontal disease, whereas SUCNR1 knockout mice were protected from inflammation, oral dysbiosis, and subsequent periodontal bone loss in two different models of periodontitis. Therapeutic studies demonstrated that a novel SUCNR1 antagonist inhibited inflammatory events and osteoclastogenesis in vitro and reduced periodontal bone loss in vivo. Our study reveals a previously unknown action of succinate in promoting periodontitis and provides a novel topical treatment for this disease.
